## Short description
 
 üåç This is the app that allows you check a weather forecast around you and your favorite places around the world. It works on [Tommorow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io) API. User can observe a weather for it's current location and search it for any place. 
 
My idea was to create a project that will looks like the standart Weather app from Apple and get more practice and confident of working with REST API, practice Combine and Concurrency.
